# FSAE - DDPG Racing Car in Pybullet

This project implements a reinforcement learning agent using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to control a racing car in the PyBullet physics simulation environment. The goal is to train the agent to navigate a race track as quickly as possible while staying on the track.
